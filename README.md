# StudyBuddy

This is a project by @dsmasrani and @rotih aiming to change how users access ChatGPT. The aim is to allow any user to upload a folder full of documents to ChatGPT (textbooks, powerpoints, pdf files, etc.) and ask it questions based on the context provided.

Currently, the system can support `.pdf`, with the expectation to support `.txt`, `.pptx`, `.csv`, `.docx` and many more in the future.
